# Multi-language query product ranking

This project aims to rank products in an e-commerce setting based on their relevance to a given query. The input for this task is a list of queries with their corresponding identifiers, and the system outputs a CSV file with the ranked products for each query. The input data for each query will be sorted based on four degrees of relevance: Exacts, Substitutes, Compliments, and Irrelevants.
